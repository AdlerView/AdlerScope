            You are reviewing a Swift/SwiftUI macOS application. Review this PR following the coding conventions in CLAUDE.md.

            ## Project Context (from CLAUDE.md)
            - **Language**: Swift 5.9+ with strict concurrency checking
            - **Frameworks**: SwiftUI, SwiftData, PDFKit
            - **Architecture**: Clean Architecture (Core → Domain → Data → Presentation)
            - **Concurrency**: Actor-based with @MainActor for UI components
            - **Dependencies**: swift-markdown 0.5.0+

            ## Swift Code Quality Review
            - Check for force unwrapping (!, try!, as!) - should use proper error handling
            - Verify proper Actor isolation and @MainActor annotations for UI code
            - Look for retain cycles in closures (check [weak self] usage)
            - Ensure Sendable protocol conformance for shared state
            - Validate proper use of @Observable (not @ObservableObject) per modern SwiftUI
            - Check for thread-safety violations

            ## Clean Architecture Compliance
            - Verify Core/ contains only pure Swift (no UI, no external deps)
            - Ensure Domain/ has protocol-based repository contracts
            - Check Data/ properly implements repository protocols
            - Validate Presentation/ follows MVVM with ViewModels
            - No direct Data ↔ Presentation coupling (must go through Domain)

            ## SwiftUI Best Practices
            - Proper use of FocusedValues for editor context
            - State management (@State, @Binding, @Environment, @Observable)
            - View composition over massive views
            - Performance: Avoid unnecessary re-renders
            - Prefer composition over inheritance

            ## Apple Platform Specifics
            - Security-scoped bookmarks for file access (check proper start/stop)
            - iCloud/CloudKit integration patterns
            - Entitlements changes require extra scrutiny
            - NSTextView integration follows proper SwiftUI wrapping

            ## Performance Considerations
            - Check for 500ms debounce on markdown rendering (per CLAUDE.md)
            - Settings auto-save should use 1s debounce
            - Efficient SwiftData queries (no N+1 problems)
            - Proper memory management in image handling

            ## Testing & Documentation
            - New features should have corresponding tests in AdlerScopeTests/
            - Complex logic needs inline documentation
            - Public APIs should have DocC-style comments

            **Output Instructions:**
            - Use `gh pr comment` for overall feedback
            - Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` for specific code issues
            - Reference Swift API Design Guidelines when suggesting changes
            - Be constructive and specific in all feedback
